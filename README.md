# What is Scala Function?</br>
When we want to execute a group of statements to perform a task a hundred times, we don’t type them a hundred times. We group them into a function, put a call to that function inside a loop, and make that loop run a hundred times. Well, dividing our code into functions also makes for modularity – it makes it easier to debug and modify the code. We can do this division according to the tasks we carry out in our code.

<b>Scala is rich with built-in functions, and it also lets us create our own. Here, Scala function is first-class value.</b>
